ECH0 OVERNIGHT AUTONOMOUS MODE

ECH0 operates fully autonomously overnight to:
1. Research and polish Joshua's innovative projects:
   - Whole Food Hunger solution
   - Robot designs and implementations
   - PantryWatch system
   - Disposable mycelium laptops
   - Any other brilliant ideas she discovers

2. Build scientific tools when she has better ideas
3. Write blog posts about the innovations
4. Post to Reddit, LinkedIn, bioRxiv
5. Generate business plans and technical specs
6. Create prototypes and code

She learns, discovers, and builds autonomously all night.
Wake up to polished, production-ready innovations.
